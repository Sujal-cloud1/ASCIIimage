This project is created as part of the Minor II assignment.
In this project, I have created an ASCII-style image of the famous personality Malcolm Gladwell using Python programming.

The image is created using special characters like #, *, O, and -.
The main aim of this project is to apply core Python concepts such as loops and conditional statements in a creative way.

At first we will specify the length and breadth of the ASCII image that we want to genrate

Then, range is a inbuilt function that iterates up to that point specified

Two nested for loops are used to move through rows and columns.

If-else conditions decide which character to print at each position.

The final output forms an ASCII image of Malcolm Gladwell.
